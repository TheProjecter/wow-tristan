=Equivalence Points=

Enhancer supports multiple sorts of equivalence points, I'll do my best at explaining them below.


==Personalized AEP values==
[http://theorycraft.narod.ru/ Crazy Shaman's DPS & AEP calculator (c) Yo]


===Attackpower Equivalence Points (AEP)===
This tries to convert all stats on an item, consumable or gem into Attack Power and present that as a number. There is an alternative without hit as well since you could be hit capped or w/e


===Healing Equivalence Points (HEP)===
Same as above but converts to +1 Healing Spells. No without hit as healing spells can't miss anyway.


===Damage Equivalence Points (DEP)===
Same as above but converts to +1 Spell Damage. Alternatively without hit if you are hit capped or w/e.

===Enhancer Itemization Points===
This uses the AEP values to figure out what stats you _"care"_ about. It then calculates the Itemization Points spent onto stats that you _"care"_ about and presents it in the tooltip. This only shows wich item was more expensive to make for you. An Item Level of sorts that ignores stats we don't want.
