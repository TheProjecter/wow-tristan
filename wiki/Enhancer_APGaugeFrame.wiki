=Attack Power Gauge=
Spec: *Enhancement*

===Details===
http://wow-tristan.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/WikiImages/APGauge.jpg

This is just a simple square frame with a changing colorized filling.

Green = Relatively much attack power.

Orange = Relatively mid attack power.

Red = Relatively low attack power.

When the bar is greenish or above 50% is a good time to recast Healing Stream Totem and such considering we get Spell Damage and Healing from AP.
