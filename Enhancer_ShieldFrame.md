# Shield #
Spec: **Enhancement**, **Restoration**, **Elemental**


### Usefull info ###
This module will let you know if you have a shield up or not (only Lightning and Water).

The text below is the time left on the shield, the number in the center is charges. If you don't have a shield a strange icon will take place to remind you to activate one (Molten Armor Icon).

### To do ###
Quick cooldown when a charge is used up to indicate another one can't be lost at the moment. But need to find the exact time for that cooldown.

### Usefull Commands ###
