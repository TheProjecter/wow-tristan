Quick introduction:
	The console command is /Enhancer or /enh. Personally I prefer the DeuceCommander AddOn
	for navigating menus but taste differs.

Example (most used) commands:
	/enh lock
	/enh elementframes
	/enh bonusframes
	/enh snap

AddOns that enable extra features in Enhancer are:
	Most scrolling combat text AddOns can take totem warnings through SinkLib
	Cartographer will enable me to give you range indication to your totems
	Waterfall-1.0 will give you access to /enh waterfall for configuration
