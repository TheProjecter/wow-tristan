			Want to translate?
			
			Copy everything from Localization-enUSlua into this file: Search and replace enUS with deDE
			
			Then translate the right hand side of everything, (here's a German example):
			["lock_cmd"] = "Sperren",
			...
			["eep_info"] = "Enhancer's Vergleichspunkte:",
		
			Anything ending with _cmd is used as a console commmand and I usually try to keep those as one word.
			Things like: ["Gem"] = true should be translated as ["Gem"] = "Edelstein" since true can only be used in the enUS locale
			
			Once you are done mail it to me at dennis.hafstrom@gmail.com and I'll add it to the distributed files :)
